[Elveflow](https://elveflow.com) offers a standard development kit for LabVIEW, C++, Python and MATLAB. 
Our package allows developers to integrate Elveflow systems into their own control programs. Those libraries enable a fast & easy integration of our instruments in your lab project.
**The Elveflow Smart Interface software installation is required before using the SDK.** 
You can download the ESI by following this [link](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-products/microfluidics-software/elveflow-software-sdk/ "Elveflow Software & SDK").
**Please refer to the [SDK userguide](/User Guide SDK V3_06_00.pdf) before using the software.**
You will also find two Jupyter Notebook tutorials to help you get started :
[SDK Tutorial Part 1 - Environment Setup](/SDK Tutorial Part 1 - Env. Setup.ipynb)
[SDK Tutorial Part 2 - Automatic Control](/SDK Tutorial Part 2 - Automatic Control.ipynb)

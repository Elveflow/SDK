**Elveflow Software Development Kit**

[Elveflow](https://elveflow.com) offers a standard development kit for LabVIEW, C++, Python and MATLAB.  
Our package allows developers to integrate Elveflow systems into their own control programs.  
Those libraries enable a fast & easy integration of our instruments in your lab project.  

**The Elveflow Smart Interface software installation is required before using the SDK.**  
You can download the ESI by following this [link](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-products/microfluidics-software/elveflow-software-sdk/ "Elveflow Software & SDK").  

**Please refer to the [SDK userguide](User%20Guide%20SDK%20V3_06_00.pdf) before using the software.**

You will also find two Jupyter Notebook tutorials to help you get started :  
[SDK Tutorial Part 1 - Environment Setup](SDK%20Tutorial%20Part%201%20-%20Env.%20Setup.ipynb)  
[SDK Tutorial Part 2 - Automatic Control](SDK%20Tutorial%20Part%202%20-%20Automatic%20Control.ipynb)

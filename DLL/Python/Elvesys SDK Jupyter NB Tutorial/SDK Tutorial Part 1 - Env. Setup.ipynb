    "# Elveflow SDK Tutorial Part 1: Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Jupyter Notebook is to work as a quick guide to the SDK development with the Elveflow products. The process is shown using a OB1 Pressure Controller with a FS5D Flow Sensor, but it works also for any other Elvesys product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting with this introduction, make sure you have read all the documentation related to your purchased products. Disregarding that information could **increase the risk of damage** to the equipment, or the risk of personal injuries. In case you don't have a copy, you can download all the documents from our [website](https://support.elveflow.com/support/home).\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of this chapter of the tutorial is the following:\n",
    "1. System setup\n",
    "2. SDK files\n",
    "3. Instrument configuration\n",
    "4. Sensor addition\n",
    "5. System calibration\n",

    "This tutorial has been written and tested using Windows 10, 64bits, Python 3.8.8, Jupyter Notebook 6.3.0 in October, 2021.\n",
    "The pressure controller is an OB1 MK3+ and the flow sensor a FS5D.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 SDK files\n",
    "The Elveflow Software Development Kit (SDK) latest stable version can be downloaded from the Elveflow [website](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-products/microfluidics-software/elveflow-software-sdk/). To alleviate bandwidth and access issues, two links for the same file are provided. You can also find the ESI in the same zip archive file.\n",
    "In case you previously installed the ESI software, a zip folder will also have been added in the same folder of ESI. Unzip it at an easily accessible path like 'C:/dev/SDK' as for now, it is necessary to hardcode some paths on the library to customize it for your own system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, go into: '../SDK/Python64' (at the path where you unzipped the SDK), or your eauivalent for 32bits, open the file 'Elveflow.py' with a text editor and edit the fifth line of the code to match the path of your SDK.\n",
